## Problems

### Code implementation (5 points, equally distributed among the functions)

Pass test cases by implementing the functions in the `src` directory. Note that the functions in `src.display` do not have test cases. However, they will still be graded.

### Free-response questions (4 points total)
While working through `notebooks/hw1-notebook.ipynb`, answer the following free-response questions in a separate document, saved as a **.pdf** and **uploaded to Canvas**. (These questions don't make sense in isolation. They only make sense in the context of the notebook)

#### Part 1 (1 point, equally split among the questions)
1A. Describe the shape of the waveform and spectrogram.

1B. Describe the shape of the waveform and spectrogram in comparison to the previous example (1A) .

1C. Describe the sound of synthesized output in comparison to the previous example (1A).
    
1D. Explain why this example sounds different than the previous example (1A).

1E. Describe the shape of the waveform and spectrogram in comparison to the previous example (1B-D).

1F. Describe the sound of synthesized output in comparison to the previous example (1B-D).
  
1G. Explain why this example sounds different than the previous example (1B-D)

#### Part 2 (2 points, equally split among the questions)
2A. Working from the DFT equation show that this statement is true.

2B. Working from the equation for the DFT, show that the magnitude spectrum of an impulse is a constant for all DFT frequencies.

2C. Work from the DFT equation to explain what is going when we delay and impulse by `d` samples.

#### Part 3 (1 point, equally split among the questions)
3A. What's going on? Why does it sound different?

3B. Save the output to `../outputs/c_major_scale_spectrogram.pdf`. Provide the parameters you used, and explain why each parameter was chosen.

3C. Save the output to `../outputs/c_major_scale_spectrogram_2.pdf`. Provide the functions and parameters you used, and explain why each function and parameter was chosen.

3D. With your favorite spectral visualization you've found so far, go back and plot `x_11khz` again. Save the output to `../outputs/c_major_scale_spectrogram_11khz.pdf`. Describe what you see visually.
