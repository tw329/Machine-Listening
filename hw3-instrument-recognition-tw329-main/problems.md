## Problems

### Notebook questions (12 points total, equally distributed among the questions)
Work through `notebooks/hw3-notebook.ipynb`, filling in code and responses when asked. Plots (and code to produce them) and text responses must be present to get points. **MAKE SURE TO COMMIT AND PUSH THIS NOTEBOOK TO GITHUB**. No PDF submission is necessary.
