## Problems

### Code implementation (6 points, equally distributed among the functions)

Pass test cases by implementing the functions in the `src` directory. These functions will be visually inspected as well.

### Free-response questions (6 points total, equally distributed among the parts)
Work through `notebooks/hw2-notebook.ipynb`, filling in code and responses when asked. Plots (and code to produce them) and text responses must be present to get points. **MAKE SURE TO COMMIT AND PUSH THIS NOTEBOOK TO GITHUB**. No PDF submission is necessary.
