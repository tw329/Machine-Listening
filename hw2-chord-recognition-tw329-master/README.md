# HW2: Chord Recognition

**IMPORTANT: PUT YOUR UCID IN THE FILE** `ucid` in the root directory of the assignment. 
This is used to put the autograder output into Canvas. Please don't put someone else's ucid 
here, we will check. The ucid should be placed into that file by itself as the only line, 
with lower case letters and no carriage returns. 

The line that is marked UCID_GOES_HERE should be REPLACED with YOUR ucid.

In this assignment, you will:
- Build a chord recognizer and evaluate its constituent parts.

## What to do for this assignment

What to do for this assignment is detailed in **problems.md**. To pass the test cases you will edit the files in the `src` directory. You will also need to launch JupyterLab and run through `notebook/hw2-notebook.ipynb`, filling out code blocks and answering questions within the notebook when asked.

Do not edit anything in the `tests` directory. Files can be added to `tests` but files that exist already cannot be edited.
